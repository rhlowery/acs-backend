# acs-backend

This project provides the backend services for the Access Control System (ACS), including access request management, auditing, and a generic interface for various data catalogs.

## Features

- **Generic Catalog Interface**: Traversal and policy overlay for Unity Catalog, AWS Glue, Iceberg, and more via a pluggable SPI.
- **Access Request Workflow**: Automated submission and approval flow with lineage tracking.
- **Observability**: Built-in support for OpenTelemetry and OpenLineage.
- **Security**: JWT integration for secure API access.

## Architecture

Detailed architecture documentation, including C4 and UML diagrams, is available via the Maven site:
```shell script
./mvnw site
```

## Testing

The project uses a TDD approach with Cucumber for BDD testing. To run the tests:
```shell script
./mvnw test
```

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at <http://localhost:8080/q/dev/>.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:

```shell script
./mvnw package
```

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.jar.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/acs-backend-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult <https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling>.
